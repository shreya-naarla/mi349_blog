            <h2>My UK Study Abroad Experience</h2>
            <p><strong>Author: Shreya Naarla</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Published: October 13, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>I loved the my study abroad experience. It was really nice exploring both London and Edinburgh and since we had long weekends I got the chance to take the time to travel on my own and see Paris as well. All three locations had so many different places to visit within the cities and it was really fun seeing all the different famous attractions that I had heard about in person, such as the Eiffel Tower or Stirling Castle. I really enjoyed visiting the slightly lesser known places that I hadn't heard of before too, like The Shard, which I learned was the tallest building in London. It was also interesting to see all the differences between each of the locations and America, even though all the places I visited were so close together they were all very unlike each other, even more so from America. It made me realize that it would be nice to live abroad in the future, even if I dont I still considered the fact that it might be nice to live in a big city like London. At the very least I definitely want to travel more so I can see more places like where we visited or visit different countries like a place that is non English speaking. While I was in London, I Saw Spirited Away being performed in Japanese with captions, that made me realize that I could find ways to make communication easier and be able to explore locations like that.</p>

            <h2>My Taste In Music</h2>
            <p><strong>Author: Shreya Naarla</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Published: October 13, 2024</strong></p>
            <p>I listen to music everyday. I have music playing on my airpods when I'm studying, playing games, and when I'm just trying to pass time. I have several different playlists and listen to a lot of different songs. I usually just listen to my favorite artists the most but I also occasionally look for music from artists I don't know so I can find some new things to listen to. I like to look at music charts or scroll through popular sounds on TikTok and add the songs I like to one of my Spotify playlists, sometimes I'll also find “unofficial” songs released by artists and add those to my SoundCloud playlist. My largest playlist is around 65 hours long, I add songs to my playlists everytime I hear a song I don't know and like. Since I'm not very picky with genres, for me to decide if music is good, I just listen to the melody, lyrics don't decide for me if I like a song but if the lyrics are good I'm more likely to like the song more because if it sounds good and has a nice meaning then I will probably play it more often.</p>
